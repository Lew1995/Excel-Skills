# Data-skills
## Projects for different data skills
### Project 1 
My first project was using a data set in excel to create and customise the dataset to be able to use the data on another sheet so that the database would use the vlookup formula to get the information from the seperate table. This would provide less human error and would allow a more seamless interaction with the data. The data has also had filters applied to it so that the information is easily navigated and I have also used conditional formatting on the data with and traffic light system so that it is easily understood.

I then used the other sheet on excel to have the tables which would be used for the vlookup formulas so that they would be able to get the information and then transfer it to the main database sheet.

The last sheet is the anaylsis sheet that shows the total grade that was achieved and counts the number of students that have achieved their expected grades or have went above them or below.

### Project 2

In this project, I used python to practice trying to use a dataset to be able to use the data and to be able to find the data that I needed. This meant that I was using different methods such as slicing as well as uploading the dataset from the google drive to be able to use the dataset and manipulate the data so that I can successfully practice with it.

I then practiced adding different coloumns into the data in python as well as adding a true and false statement so that the scores that were achieved would be catagorised.
