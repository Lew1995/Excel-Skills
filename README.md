### Excel project 
My first project was using a dataset in Excel which was supplied by Bede College while I did my IT course. This was a plain spreadsheet and therefore needed to be changed so that the data would be easier to understand and the way that I did this was by using filter along the coloumns so that the information could be filtered and that whoever used the spreadsheet could find what they were looking for more easily. I also used the conditional format feature using a traffic light system so that the information would be instantly easier to understand. In Excel I also used different formulas such as VLOOKUP and COUNTIF.

I then used the other sheet on Excel to have the tables which would be used for the VLOOKUP formulas so that they would be able to get the information and then transfer it to the main database sheet, this would stop any human error since the information would be brought from an entirely different database and would therefore give the user more reliance on the information in it.

The last sheet is the analysis sheet that shows the total grade that was achieved and counts the number of students that have achieved their expected grades. The sheet also shows visual representation of the overall grades of all of the students and shows how many students obtained each grade.
