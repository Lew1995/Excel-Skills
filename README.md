# Data-skills
## Projects for different data skills
### Project 1 
My first project was using a data set in excel to create and customise the dataset to be able to use the data on another sheet so that the database would use the vlookup formula to get the information from the seperate table. This would provide less human error and would allow a more seamless interaction with the data. The data has also had filters applied to it so that the information is easily navigated and I have also used conditional formatting on the data with and traffic light system so that it is easily understood.
